# reversing-whatsapp-sqlite-2024
The repository documents my process of reverse engineering the database schema and key tables in WhatsApp's SQLite databases you can find in your Android device. 
It also includes some SQL queries to automate data extraction and analysis, shedding light on how you can recover information from these local files.

This project is intended for educational and research purposes only.
