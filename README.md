# Reversing Whatsapp's SQLite (in 2024)
This repository documents my process of trying a reverse-engineering of the database schema and key tables in WhatsApp's SQLite databases. 
These are files you can access with all kinds of file manager application on your Android device after launching a backup via the application's settings menu.
It also includes some SQL queries to automate data extraction and analysis, shedding light on how you can reconstruct humanly-readable information from these files.

The information you find here are surely valid for WhatsApp's versions ranging from 2.23.XX.XX to 2.24.19.86. 
I also expect this to still be useful for researching and analyzing instances of older versions with minimal changes. 
As this has been an individual project, I had to rely on versions I personally used and therefore had the possibility to test for. 

This project is intended for educational and research purposes only.
